Everyone's knee deep in roster drama, so I'm here to wade through the [wall of text](http://www.dota2.com/springcleaning) that was the spring cleaning update. Inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4bl98d/spring_cleaning_update_balance_implications/), here are some notable balance changes I noticed that basically made this patch 6.86g.

### Heroes

#### Bristleback

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Warpath not being disabled by Break</font>**

Silver Edge was already a good item for killing Bristle, now it's even better.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/broodmother.jpg)


#### Broodmother

* **<font color='green'>Spiderlings and Spiderites can now be set to two different control groups</font>**

Very pleasant quality of life change for Brood.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/dazzle.jpg)


#### Dazzle

* **<font color='green'>Assists now get counted whenever you place debuff on an enemy hero that dies</font>**
* **<font color='green'>Assists now get counted whenever you place a buff on a hero that kills an enemy hero</font>**

Buff to Dazzle KDA stats. Though I'll reiterate again for the thousandth time that the *scoreboard has no reflection on assist gold earned*. It's just a number.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/death_prophet.jpg)


#### Death Prophet

* **<font color='green'>Fixed recasting Exorcism not causing existing ghosts to return to you and heal</font>**

No, you can't cast it on demand to return your ghosts, this is just an interaction with Refresher Orb. Yes, technically this is a DP buff, but the context in which you would need to immediately return Exorcism for the burst heal means you're probably near death. Would you really want to risk re-casting a refreshed Exorcism if you're near death? Probably not.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/enchantress.jpg)


#### Enchantress

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Untouchable lingering when attempting to attack units other than Enchantress</font>**

Yea that was annoying.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/huskar.jpg)


#### Huskar

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Life Break Immunity not lasting long enough</font>**

It used to work that if Huskar Life Broke you and you Blinked or created a gap, Huskar would lose his immunity halfway through the jump. Now he keeps it the whole way until he connects.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/invoker.jpg)


#### Invoker

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Ice Wall debuff lingering on heroes that become Spell Immune</font>**

Quite a nerf. Ice Wall used to be sticky for 2 seconds after a unit would go Spell Immune. 2 seconds is an eternity in the late game.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/juggernaut.jpg)


#### Juggernaut

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Omnislash being affected by Damage Block</font>**

Crimson Guard isn't as nice of an early pickup against Jugg.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/lycan.jpg)


#### Lycan

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Lycan's ult wolf changing into a headless Lycan model on death</font>**

rip tf2 soldier death



![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/medusa.jpg)


#### Medusa

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Mystic Snake ending if it hits an invisible unit</font>**

I don't play much Dusa, but supposedly this is a nice buff.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/ogre_magi.jpg)


#### Ogre Magi

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Multicast Ignite's interaction with Linken's Sphere</font>**
* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Multicast Ignite affecting units in FoW</font>**
* **<font color='green'>Fixed Bloodlust not being castable on Invulnerable allies/buildings</font>**

Ogre can't take stacks as easily or randomly detect enemies and disable their Blink Daggers for no reason when units are in the fog. Also, Linken's used to pop even if you were a Multicasted Ignite target, now it'll only pop if you're the primary target.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/phoenix.jpg)


#### Phoenix

* **<font color='indianred'>Attack Speed changes during an attack now causes the animation and attack timings to update dynamically</font>**

This isn't *specifically* a nerf to Phoenix, but this definitely affects Phoenix. Spamming Fire Spirits and then going into Supernova is pretty much a staple of the hero. If enemies can now recover their AS halfway through an attack without having to cancel it, that could be the difference between 1 or 2 more attacks on the egg.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/phantom_assassin.jpg)


#### Phantom Assassin

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed various attack animation prediction exploits (such as Coup de Grace)</font>**

lel

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/pugna.jpg)

#### Pugna

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Nether Ward damage not disabling Blink</font>**

DUDE. I was also so incredibly confused when a LC would Press her attack, get flared, and *still* blink and Duel my ass. Buff against Centaur, LC, Sand King, Tide, basically any hero that likes using a spell or mana-costing item before jumping into a fight. Like LC. Screw you LC.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/rubick.jpg)

#### Rubick

* **<font color='green'>Fixed stolen Ignite not getting Multicast bonuses</font>**

Noice.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/sand_king.jpg)


#### Sand King

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Sandstorm being canceled by purge</font>**

A very rare interaction, but there have been multiple times that I used Brewmaster's Storm Panda to get SK out of Sandstorm.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/slark.jpg)


#### Slark

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Shadow Dance not granting passive bonuses if affected by vision spells like Amplify Damage</font>**

This is only a fix for when Slark actually *activates* Shadow Dance. He still can't passively heal if in Thirst range by a Bloodseeker, or under Track/Amp Damage.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/sniper.jpg)


#### Sniper

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Headshot damage going through Spell Immunity</font>**
* **<font color='indianred'>Attack Speed changes during an attack now causes the animation and attack timings to update dynamically</font>**

According to the wiki, on average, Headshot increases Sniper's damage output by 6/16/26/36. Small nerf. Also the AS speed change that I mentioned under Phoenix affects Headshot as well.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/spirit_breaker.jpg)


#### Spirit Breaker

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Charge of Darkness not destroying trees at the end of the charge</font>**

Hooray, no more getting stuck in trees after canceled Charges.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/sven.jpg)


#### Sven

* **<font color='green'>Fixed Stormhammer behavior when the primary target is hidden upon impact</font>**

Storm Hammer now stuns the AoE if the primary target is banished/hidden (Astral Imprisonment, Disruption, Snowball, Phase Shift, Doppelganger). If the spell is disjointed, it still does nothing on landing.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/templar_assassin.jpg)


#### Templar Assassin

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Psi Blades triggering when attacks land on dead units</font>**

Ouch. This is a fairly notable nerf to TA's laning stage. The attack will still spill if you get the deny hit, but if you're too late, no more spill. A lot of TA's free harass came from these attacks, especially when enemy mids were trying to last hit under their tower.

![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/tidehunter.jpg)


#### Tidehunter

* **<font color='green'>Equipped taunts will now automatically play in-game under a variety of rare circumstances</font>**

Game breaking.


![Hero](/assets/media/heroes/large/visage.jpg)


#### Visage

* **<font color='indianred'>Fixed Stone Form stunning and damaging units if the Familiar died while landing</font>**
* **<font color='indianred'>Familiars are now properly affected by movement speed changes and disables such as stuns or roots</font>**

Two Visage nerfs. The second one isn't as bad as I thought when I first read it. Familiars are still immune to magic, but now they'll get CC'd by spell-immune piercing stuns/roots (Primal Roar, Black Hole, Overgrowth, Naga's Ensnare, etc.)

----

*That's about all I considered to be significant for heroes. There are plenty of other changes, but either I don't play the hero enough to know how notable a change is, or it's an interaction that occurs rarely to begin with. If you see anything worth mentioning that I missed, let me know [@tsunami643](https://twitter.com/tsunami643).*


### Items

* **Added range indicator for items on hover**

Uhhh, supposedly this was added, but I see nothing in the Test client when I hover over items. If it ever works, this would be a cool buff to Blink Dagger initiators to get 1200 range perfectly every time.

* **Added support (Ctrl-Shift click) for appending to the quickbuy panel to add individual items**

This is super useful and I recommend people get used to using this. For supports that want quick info on cooldown'd items (wards, gem, smoke, Flying Courier) while still having access to other items or for carries building expensive items who might need to buy out something cheaper if they're getting ganked (AM going for Battle Fury, but finishes Treads if he knows he's about to die).

* **Fixed Boots of Travel canceling when upgrading to Level 2**

How on earth was this happening so frequently that I saw like 5 threads on /r/dota2 about this interaction. I mean, I know it's silly that it was broken, but why the hell were you buying level 2 BoTs if you weren't even trying to TP onto an ally hero to begin with.

* **Fixed courier travelling deeper into the fountain than necessary in order to interact with the stash**

Buff to mids.

* **Fixed a rare bug that could cause Item icons to be stuck on your cursor**

Somehow I'm skeptical.

### Misc

* **Fixed Roshan to update his health immediately on the upgrade timer, rather than the next time he spawns**

This is a nerf to early Rosh takers that aren't Ursa. Ursa doesn't really care because a bit more health here and there is a matter of 3-4 auto attacks when he has a billion Fury Swipe stacks. Lycan, TA, Meepo, Troll, and other heroes that like taking an early Rosh will get hurt. Rosh gets 500 HP every 4 minutes. Seeing as how most early Rosh attempts occur at ~12+ minutes, that's a new 1500 HP that you'll have to burn through.

### Wishlist

* **Fixed Bloodlust not being castable on Invulnerable allies/buildings**

I'm a fan. But why not Ice Armor and Living Armor as well? Ice Armor, mainly.

* **Added a UI setting for disabling camera zoom**

It would be nice if this would be segregated between spectating and playing. I hate accidentally zooming when I'm playing, but I love zooming out when I'm spectating.

* **Effigies and Barracks now name the player that killed them in the chat log**

This should be a thing with Rosh as well. Few players pay attention to this, but Rosh provides a bounty from 150-400g to the player that last hits him in addition to the 200g team bounty.

* **Added range indicator for items on hover**

Why are mana costs on items still not shown like spells. The biggest thing I hated about Reborn killing `-enableaddons` was that I couldn't use [this mod anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/22a57n/for_those_interested_ive_made_an_item_icon/) There's really no reason why items shouldn't show mana costs on their icons. Valve is touching far more sacred territory with this whole tower aggro and neutral camp spawn box info on demand. GIVE ME MANA COSTS.

* **The chat cheat `-item` no longer requires the full item name, it will instead match to a substring to create the item**
* **Added a chat cheat `-lvlmax` that levels your hero to the max and skills all your abilities**

Oh, hey, neat. As long as we're messing with cheats, could I also get `-toggledaynight` for

    dota_daynightcycle_toggle

`-pausedaynight` for

    dota_daynightcycle_pause 1

`-roshan` for

    dota_respawn_roshan

And a command to remove all the trees on the map would be sweet. `-trees` respawns all of them, but a command that does the opposite would be convenient.

Cool, thanks.
