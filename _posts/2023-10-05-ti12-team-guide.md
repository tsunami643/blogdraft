### Or more accurately, "The *Road* to the International 2023: A Practical Guide"

The what?

The *Road*, my friends. The *Road*.

---

Group stage is completely different from before. No longer is it two big ole' groups that half the teams get shoved in to. In an effort to make group stage games higher stakes, Valve has now split the 20 teams into 4 different groups.

ESL didn't get any DPC tours "We'll make our own tour" "ESL Pro Tour," or EPT for short. This circuit consisted of culminating in the *Riyadh Masters 2023* with a whopping $15MM prize pool.

These forewords are usually more for my benefit so I can keep track of all the 

Let's get started.

**How did this roster happen?** After MATUMBAMAN [died last TI](https://youtu.be/s51F0JhAPHU?t=29), a void was left in this roster. Thankfully, the Team Liquid Academy Team, also known as "*Team Secret*," was hard at work training up another prospect ripe for the picking by the name of Nisha.

You know how you probably associate Sumail as being on Evil Geniuses for like... ever? King played on EG for four years, from 2015 to 2019. Nisha on Secret? 2018 to 2022. Four years is a long time under one banner and despite a stellar 2<sup>nd</sup> place finish with Secret last TI, he seemed ready to move on.

So the year started off-- wait, sorry. Gotta fix my formatting.

<p style="background: #bebebe">So the year started off pretty good for Liquid. Nisha instantly gelled with the team and they got a 2<sup>nd</sup> place finish in Lima despite Boxi having to leave mid-way through the tournament.</p>

<p style="background: #bebebe">But then it happened again.</p>

<p style="background: #bebebe">And again.</p>

<p style="background: #bebebe"><b>And again.</b></p>

It would've been funny if it wasn't so sad. Actually that's a lie, it was still pretty funny. After being stonewalled by a Western European nemesis for 3 LANs straight, Liquid finally conquered their demons at Riyadh before once more fumbling the bag against Team Spirit in grand finals.

**What would success look like?** Fun fact: Do you know who the highest earning Dota 2 player that hasn't won TI is? [It's zai.](./../../../img/ti12teams/zaiesportsearnings.jpg) Even more impressive is he's done that without ever even being in a TI grand finals.

Can Liquid finally do it? Or is this team just destined for silver medals.

<br>
<br>

Anyways, a Western European nemesis, you say? Who were they? I bet it was Team Secret. Ooh, or maybe OG? Tundra? NIGMA?!

Nope. It was

**How did this roster happen?** This is the same roster as last year barring some cool, calm, collection. While on the brink of contemplating retirement when Quincy Crew/Soniqs disintegrated after last TI, Quinn was given the opportunity to export himself to this Western European squad taking the place of former midlaner BOOM. Meanwhile, BOOM went to Secret and Secret went boom.

*GAIMIN* was Liquid's nemesis??? Yes, you're reading that correctly. We had to watch the same grand final. Every. Single. Major.

If you didn't have any strong opinions about this team last year, I wouldn't blame you. They were distinctly 'middle of the pack' material by WEU standards.

If you didn't have any strong opinions about this team this year, you're a unicorn.

But following 
Bunch of firsts. Was an interesting journey for a team that not many people thought about to a team that a lot of people began actively disliking. There are a variety of factors.

One is that, well, they're just very good. And if you're constantly very good, people get annoyed that you keep making everyone else look very bad.

Two is compounded by the fact that Liquid were doing them no favors by getting bopped by them in every single grand final. It was almost pre-determined. OHH BOY, GAIMIN'S IN GRAND FINALS AND LIQUID'S MAKING A LOWER BRACKET RUN, GEE I WONDER WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT.

Three is Quinn. Part of it... no, most of it is self-inflicted. He's a very colorful individual. I don't think I've seen people enjoy hatewatching a player this much since the days of internationally renowned day trader EternalEnvy.

**What would success look like?** They already made history by being the first time in Dota 2 history to ever win every major of the season. Ya gotta finish the story now.

Also, I unironically believe a large number of Redditors may just straight up kill themselves to avoid living in a timeline where Quinn Callahan is a TI winner.

**How did this roster happen?** Ah yes, the current reigning TI champio-- <span style="font-size: 42px"><b>IS THAT TOPSON?</b> <img class="batchest" title="HECKIN' LOVE TOPSON" src="./../../../img/ti12teams/batchest.png"></span>

Yes, but show some decorum. The main reason Topson is here is because Tundra, specifically Saksa, had a pretty rough year and was mysteriously missing from a handful of events before publicly [opening up](https://twitter.com/Saksadota/status/1682719745110310912) that he's been struggling with anxiety, sleep, and mental health. Even TI winners are human.

In the eleventh hour, Topson, who had spent most of his year farting around on the meme-but-jk-not-really-meme team Old G, was called up to bat moving Nine to 4 position duties.

You couldn't pay me enough to cover all the Old G drama this year.

As mentioned earlier, you'll notice a lot of stand-in asterisks by these results. For DLS19, Aramis stood in for Saksa. For DLS20, Malr1ne stood in for Nine. And for Bali and Riyadh, coach Aui stood in for Saksa.

Despite all that, pretty solid results for Tundra despite Wraith Pact being removed in April, eh?

**What would success look like?** I don't mean to alarm you, but we may be witnessing the potential of ***3*** time TI winners Topson and Aui as coach!

Sure, Topson already played a few matches with the Tundra boys during September's DreamLeague S21 and it was... fine? They only got 5-6th out of a 12 team tournament.

**How did this roster happen?** Starting from EEU Tour 1, this roster formed under the HellRaisers tag with Daxak, kiyotaka (formerly depressed kid) (as in, that was his name), Miero, Antares, and Solo. Apparently there were some... "personality clashes" with Daxak, so Yuragi stood in for him at the Lima Major despite very much still being on OG.

Beginning of EEU Tour 2, Ramzes left his Darkside roster and reunited with papa Solo for the very first time since TI9's Virtus.pro.

This year, EEU has been a rock paper scissors between three teams: 9Pandas, BetBoom, and Team Spirit.

Surprisingly, their best finish at the Berlin Major was with Rodjer standing in for Solo.

**What would success look like?** Pretty much every year that Solo and Ramzes were teammates at TI, they were considered favorites. I would know. I put them into my Compendium predictions to win it literally every time. Then that old VP would proceed to consistently drop the ball at TI7. And TI8. And TI9.

For some, the real success would be beating Gaimin specifically, but I think the Ramzes x Quinn rivalry horse was stomped to death in an elevator Refn-style one too many times this year.

**How did this roster happen?** *Whoa now, tsunami. Don't mean to tell ya yer business, but it seems to me like there's been a bit of a misunderstandin'. This here ain't EG. This some kinda... what sorta woke flags are these... this some kinda South American team? Now boy, you know that ain't right. EG's a North American org, yes sir! Always has been. North American pride and joy right there!*

Nope. Not anymore. At the beginning of this season, EG very unceremoniously (and then got cyberbullied into ceremoniously) dropped their North American roster after spending **11 years** in the region. The phrase "end of an era" gets thrown around a lot in esports, but like... every TI since TI2 with a North American EG? Wild.

As they shed their NA skin, Evil Geniuses formed a South American superteam out of last year's Thunder Awaken and beastcoast rosters. Pakazs, Matthew, and Panda came from Thunder. Chris Luck and Wisper came from beastcoast.

Lima major in peru lost to shopify

bad last half of year. That 4th place finish at the Berlin Major is the most significant placement a South American team has gotten at a Valve Major since paiN Gaming's 3rd place finish at ESL One Birmingham 2018. Though, Birmingham's [tournament format](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/ESL_One/Birmingham/2018) was on crack, so let's just gloss over it and go with Berlin being the new South American bar to beat.

Speaking of ~~crack~~ ~~bar~~

**What would success look like?** I've never seen a team where you can so clearly interpret how well they're going to do on any given day just by looking at their faces. I'm serious. Watch the VoDs on their elimination days. You'd think they were being forced to walk out on stage to play Dota at gunpoint.

For what it's worth, it *is* a Seattle TI. So there's probably a lot of EG jerseys being dug out of closets and dusted off with wives asking, "Why do you still have this? And who is Universe?" Will these vintage EG fans be rooting for this team? Probably not, but don't tell the players that. Big smiles, EG boys. Big Chris Smiles.

**How did this roster happen?** There were kinda two retirement tours on display at last year's TI. Matu's was the "I'M OUTTA HERE BITCHES" vibe and Ame's had more of a "Your father doesn't want anyone to make a fuss" energy. Nothing was ever formally announced, but everyone suspected it, and his absence this year confirmed it. LGD ended up filling Ame's carry shoes surprisingly well with young EHOME talent, shiro.

Faith_bian also retired and finding a replacement offlaner was... ugh, you know, years ago I would've looked up some deep elaborate Chinese idiomatic lore phrase to drop here, but I'm a busy man these days. I'm just gonna hit you with the <abbr title="If one of you comment 'You should use DeepL 🤓' I swear...">Google Translate</abbr>. Finding a replacement offlaner was a total 节目充满狗屎. Yeah. I'm sure that means what I want it to.

Tour 1's offlaner was 项羽/xiàng yǔ, Lima Major was old eLeVeN, Tour 2 and Berlin Major they had zeal, and Tour 3 onwards has been niu.

Also, before you ask: Yes, Ame's was *kind of* the classic "Chinese retirement" because he literally just won the [2022 Asian Games](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Asian_Games/2022) with Team China despite not playing competitively since last TI.

China has been in shambles this entire year. Tour 1 was fraught with match fixing which culminated in a massive ban wave after Lima. LGD quietly kept their head down. Perhaps a bit too down because they themselves didn't really have any notable results this year, but it's

**What would success look like?** Throw a dart at a board of all TIs ever. Odds are you'll hit one where LGD were considered favorites to win the whole thing. This year? Definitely not. Regardless, with LGD being the crown jewel of Chinese Dota, a great deal will always hang in the balance of this team's performance.

Needless to say, a lot of responsibility.

**How did this roster happen?** You already know how this roster happened. Well, most of the roster anyway. After TI11, Nightfall got replaced by Saberlight from TSM. Great you're all caught up.

The *organization*, on the other hand. How did that happen? I mean, it's not like some multibillion-dollar company's just gonna randomly decide to start investing in esports while the bubble is popping and sponsor a bunch of superstars recently dropped by their org who are playing in one of the most expensive yet competitively starved regions in *Dota 2* of all games.

But that's exactly what happened.

K1 Hector was also beastcoast's carry since 2019, but he departed before the Bali Major citing [health issues](https://twitter.com/beastcoast/status/1661500603338485762) and Parker took his spot.

As per usual, NA was mostly a two-horse race throughout the year with TSM and Shopify. Then this horse usually got turned into glue whenever it was Major time. On top of that, TSM has a tendency to fall asleep at the wheel towards the end of each season. Last year they missed Arlington, this year they missed Bali.

For what it's worth, they *did* make it to grand finals of the BetBoom Dacha LAN event in September but lost to, you guessed it: Gaimin Gladiators.

**What would success look like?** Ari's the first British player to ever compete at a Valve Major. So if they make it to Climate Pledge Arena? *USA! USA! USA! USA!*

reso standin at berlin, Bali was big drama and reso... "stood in" again. DLS20 last minute invite because execration had visa issues

**What would success look like?** Spirit winning TI10 lit a fire in the EEU region. The fire being fueled by, "Wait, *those* scrubs won? I'm definitely better than them." BetBoom was the strongest product of this initiative. And not just because Daxak could probably bench 90% of the players at TI.

Remember that Outsiders/VP team I talked about during the Fnatic points fiasco? Well BetBoom beat them 3-0 in the EEU TI11 quals to take this slot.

Western Europe is a **brutal** region. WEU sent four teams to every major this year and all of them would make top 6 *every time* barring Tundra's 9-12th at Lima. Granted, two of those were just Gaimin and Liquid in every final, but still!

Entity made waves at Lima before losing to Gaimin and Talon, but were struggling to keep their head above water in Tour 2 and 3. Only by winning relegation tiebreakers were they able to maintain a slot in Division 1.

Then I guess they just hate ESL or something? Those are some rough EPT performances.

**What would success look like?** Giving us an even better game than last year's 107 minute Bo1 against RNG.

**How did this roster happen?** Formerly known as Ooredoo Thunders, a.k.a. "The Oreoes," this team grinded their way up from Div 2 into becoming *the next big thing.*

Noob and Omar are relative newcomers to the competitive scene, but were formerly on the Coolguys roster together that competed in WEU Div 1 Tour 1 in 2022. TA2000 and kaori have been around for a few years, but always on EEU rosters. This is their first WEU team.

And the offla- DUDE I AM GETTING SICK of telling offlane stories. When did this become the most volatile role? Offlaners used to be so stable! It was the *midlaners* that would get passed around like holographic Pokémon cards at recess. Whatever, rant over. Tour 1 and 2 they had Wuiter. Starting Tour 3 they had ATF and it looked like a great fit, but due to [contract disputes](https://twitter.com/AmmarAlassaf6/status/1680210587937124355) he didn't continue with the team. They brought in Malik to stand in during Riyadh Masters before ultimately getting Tobi from Entity for their TI qualifying roster.

Can you imagine the psychological toll of playing with 4 different offlaners in 1 year? Snip, snap, snip, snap.

***NOTE TO SELF** - NOW THIS TEAM HAS THE PSG. PSG QUEST. GREAT! ANOTHER TEAM THAT USED TO HAVE A UNIQUE COLOR IS NOW JUST BLUE NOW. I'M NOT CHANGING THEIR BANNER, I REFUSE.*

Most of the year was covered in the roster explanation, so I'll just gush about how exciting it's been to watch this team's journey this year. After smashing their way through Tour 1 Div 2, they came into Tour 2 as an immediate threat and nearly qualified to the Major *in their inaugural tour*. This region's already cutthroat enough as it is. Notice how you don't see Secret, OG, or Nigma anywhere on this page?

By the time Tour 3 ended, most teams were beginning to statistically lock their chances of directly qualifying to TI through points, but the last 3-4 slots were still up in the air. Were Quest able to *win* the Bali Major, they would've just barely gotten enough points to sneak a direct TI invite. Believe it or not, that was a fairly realistic proposition, but their bracket run was cut short after losing to Gaimin and Liquid.

They would be tested one last time after making it to Riyadh Masters through a dedicated MENA region qualifier and fought their way to top 8. In a different timeline their run went even further, but their elimination series against Gaimin was plagued with technical issues and they lost.

**What would success look like?** Now that I've gassed them up: Realistically, making it past *The Road* and into *The International* final weekend will be an incredible achievement. True success will likely come for these players in the next few years.

You know how I said EEU was like a rock paper scissors game this year? VP was out here playing clarinet.

Does that mean that these guys were just being gatekept and are secretly goated with the sauce? No, probably not. They showed up to Riyadh and my first reaction was, "What's Fng doing here. Is he on the panel?"

Honestly, he probably could've shown up on the panel afterwards because they got absolutely blown to smithereens.

**What would success look like?** Not really sure. We've haven't had a TI with 3 EEU teams since TI5, forget about 4. That TI also only had 2 WEU teams with Secret and Cloud9. And North America won that TI.

What the hell was going on in 2015?

Wait, *South America #1 Qualifier*? What do you mean *#1*? I mean that besides the two SA teams that already made it to TI on points, EG and beastcoast, two *more* slots were allocated to the region for TI qualifiers. Now bear in mind, Valve determined these extra slot allocations *before* the Bali Major happened. At that moment, SA was consistently doing pretty well given the fact that they only ever to send 2 teams to each major.

**What would success look like?** To refresh your memory: TI7 was the very first TI to feature a South American team (Infamous). TI8 had the mostly Brazilian paiN Gaming to represent the region. And ever since then, it's pretty much always been the Peru show on LAN. The last time a Brazilian team made it to a Valve Major was Costabile and KJ's SG esports at TI10 that got eliminated in groups.

4nalog managed to make it out of groups last year on Hokori, but it's waaaay harder with this year's format.

Thunder was actually fairly close to qualifying to Berlin and Bali, but if you can't beat EG *or* beastcoast, it'll never happen. One must wonder that if SA had three slots per major, *would* this team do well against international opponents? Time to find out.

**What would success look like?** Forget about TI, success will mainly be determined based on the health of the South American scene in a DPC-less world. No one knows how invitations or qualifiers or points or majors or anything is going to look like next year, but performing well at TI is probably your best shot at making tournament organizers look in your direction.

K1's 'health break' off of beastcoast lasted about a month and a half before joining nouns in July.

Pour one out for Husky, though. Brother had been 5 position with Gunnar on 4 Zoomers/nouns since *August 2020* and got kicked right after the Bali Major ended. They didn't even kick him for a support player. Yamsun just straight up changed roles to make space for K1.

Usually for these regional qualifier teams, we just have to infer how they'd theoretically perform against international opponents. Thankfully for nouns, we have the data. ESL graciously granted North America three slots to DLS19 and nouns got bodied. Then TSM graciously granted nouns their slot to the Bali Major and they got bodied again.

To be fair, these were pre-K<sub>1</sub> versions of nouns. After dominating NA TI quals, it's been good times, right? Let me check some sources real quick. Ah yes, it appears they just finished playing in an online event *Pinnacle Cup: Malta Vibes #4* and got 9-12th after getting 2-0'd by a Turkish player whose handle is "Jeezy."

Hmm.

**What would success look like?** As a North American, I hate myself for saying this, but success is probably Gunnar finding a nice Western European forever team to adopt him next year. Sneyking did it, Quinn did it, Kitrak kinda did it. It... it may be time... n-no don't look at me like that. It's hard enough as it is. Go.

*I SAID GO!*

Most of the year was irrelevant, but they did get a top 8 finish at Bali. Bear in mind, however, they got that top 8 by beating one opponent in bracket: BetBoom. Was that *after* BetBoom...? Yep.

**What would success look like?** Only two Chinese teams are attending this TI. LGD and Azure Ray. Last year was already surprising with only LGD, Aster, and RNG. But only *two* Chinese teams? Never thought I'd see the day.

Lot of question marks in the air on the future state of the Chinese scene. Is most of the matchfixing resolved? Are new talent joining the competitive scene? Will we ever have international LANs there again?

MidOne spent the majority of the year taking a world tour around the Dota map. In Tour 1, 2, and Berlin he was OfflaneOne. Tour 3, he was MidOne. And from regional qualifiers to now, he's CarryOne.

SMG's been under SEA suppressing fire since org's inception in 2021 and Berlin was the first opportunity for them to play at an international LAN. It was not pretty. They only won 4 games out of 16 and 3 of them were against other teams that also got eliminated in groups.

They did dominate SEA TI quals, so not all hope is lost.

**What would success look like?** Despite withering away on Nigma Galaxy, Mind_Control gets the zoomies every time he's recruited to stand-in for another team. He subbed in for OG twice this season: Once at Berlin, ending top 6, and once again at DLS21, earning them a top 4 placement. If you wanna go way back into the archives... 2018? He also got a top 4 finish with Ninjas in Pajamas at the Kuala Lumpur Major.

And remind me again, who won TI last time it was in Seattle?
