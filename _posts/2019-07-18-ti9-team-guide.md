### It's that magical time of year again.

Players are going into stream hibernation as bootcamps begin, Arcana propaganda campaigns are getting increasingly heated, and gaming blogs are prepping their annual piece of Dota 2 coverage to report on whichever way the prize pool goes. Ah, International season.

But not everyone has been following the professional Dota 2 scene like their livelihood depended on it. Perhaps you're the viewer who was saturated by all the tournaments and are just now tuning back in for TI. Maybe your weird friend's yearly pilgrimage to Seattle has been rerouted to Vancouver and you're shocked to learn they allow this kind of degeneracy in Canada too. Or maybe you just want to enjoy the week of festivities Valve has organized around the upcoming Artifact information session.

Whatever your story, here's a preview of the teams and memes you should know come August.

Not to worry, I've developed a foolproof guide to figure out when exactly you stopped watching Dota.

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Who is the current offlaner for EG?

<select id="dropDown" onchange="test()" style="font-weight: 100;">
 <option value="default" selected="selected">Please select offlaner</option>
 <option value="one" id="s4">s4</option>

 <option value="three" id="iceiceice">iceiceice</option>
 <option value="four" id="UNiVeRsE">UNiVeRsE</option>
</select>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">You stopped watching Dota:
<span id="wrapperOne" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">After TI9</span>
<span id="wrapperTwo" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Riiiight before COVID</span>
<span id="wrapperThree" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Never. You're a fiend.</span>
<span id="wrapperFour" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Oh geez...</span>
</p>

<div id="paragraphOne" style="display: none;">

# The Invites

Eight teams were directly invited to TI8 this year through a new system Valve implemented called the *Dota Pro Circuit* or *DPC*. Instead of the old, ambiguous, invitation process of 'do pretty good in the five months before TI,' players were given a new, clearer, directive of 'do pretty good in the five months before TI and don't you dare mess with your roster.'

Twenty-two DPC tournaments later, these are the teams that either stayed after class, captained the Mechanics team, and played Varsity Dota, or the ones that showed up, got a B-, copied drafts at lunch, but still got automatic admission because the rest of the graduating class spent too much time casting Pipe of Insight under the bleachers. That’s not to say any team ended up invited due to a technicality, but make no mistake, there exists a significant gap in Dota proficiency between the upper and lower tiers of this list.

The beauty of The International is when most of these skill differences go out the window.

**How did this roster happen?** Abed. Iceiceice Fun fact, for all abuse Arteezy has endured, he is currently on the longest tenure of any Team+Player pairing at TI besides OG's Notail.

**How was their DPC year?** If you haven't watched Dota in a while you may recall that EG were notorious for always getting third place at events. Times have changed, though. That was a completely different roster, different meta, different era.

They've since moved up a digit.

They did actually get 1st in season 1 of the NA DPC (after winning a three-way tiebreaker), but after that it was 2nd at the Singapore Major, 2nd at the NA DPC season 2, and 2nd at the AniMajor. Now for a normal person, that's pretty incredible. But Dota players, and fans, are not normal people. And in true Ricky Bobby fashion, if you ain't first, you're last.

**What can we expect?** 

**What to spam in Twitch chat EG** "The current EG roster is the largest waste of potential in the history of dota."

**What would success look like?** How funny would it be if after eight years of competing in professional Dota, Arteezy's first Valve LAN event win was TI10.

**How did this roster happen?**  Even Ame, who most would consider to be a mainstay on LGD, was actually hanging around on CDEC for most of 2020 before this roster formed. Two of the Wings Gaming TI6 winning squad? Young hotshot 12k MMR midlaner? And xiao8 coaching?

**How was their DPC year?** As evidenced by the number of Chinese teams attending TI10, competition is pretty cutthroat in the region.

**What can we expect?** The lore behind TI champions is every alternate year is a "China year." TI1 - Na'Vi (Western), TI2 - iG (Chinese), TI3 - Alliance (Western), TI4 - Newbee (Chinese), TI5 - EG (Western), TI6 - Wings (Chinese), TI7 - Liquid (Western).

In other words, these guys are the world's best chance at saving Dota from becoming a ded gaem.

**How to sound smart talking about LGD** idk lol

**What would success look like?** Having said that, "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_，\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\!"

**How did this roster happen?** Normally I would just . Or I could tell you that this VP has never placed lower than Top 8 at any event. Any event. Maybe that's not impressive enough for you? How about this. Since August 2016, which is when this VP formed with Lil, this team has still <i>never placed lower than Top 8 at any event.</i>

**How did they qualify?** Got top 4 in seven out of the eight majors they attended and then proceeded to win half of them.

**What can we expect?** While VP were not the apex predators they were last season, this legendary squad has maintained the longest running roster

**How to sound smart talking about VP** "Maybe Sansheng should've written a guide on how to deal with the chat wheel."

**What would success look like?** CIS deserves another Aegis.

**How did they qualify?** After Valve finally confiscated NA's third slot to every major

**What can we expect?** Jeremy Lin to make his yearly cameo, but now with some actual skin in the game. At least I hope so. If he and Asa Butterfield move to Fortnite, we're doomed.

**How to sound smart talking about Newbee** "BSJ was just ahead of his time."

**How did this roster happen?** A whole bunch of 3<sup>rd</sup> place finishes

**How did they qualify?** TI7's runners-up gave a less than stellar performance this season, but it was enough to squeeze into the DPC top 8 for a TI invite anyway. Their biggest mistake was getting revenge on Liquid too early in the year, thus preventing the Sccc ultra instinct arc.

**What can we expect?** This squad didn't have *amazing* results before TI7 either. They were good enough to be directly invited, but most people considered LFY or LGD to be the strongest Chinese teams at that TI. Perhaps history will repeat itself.

**How to sound smart talking about Keen** "Sccc is my free pass."

**What would success look like?** "You expect to win a championship at your first TI? You're just an ordinary person... not a god. Second TI is no excuse though, you better win."

**What can we expect?** Let it All Out of You

**How to sound smart talking about Fnatic** "Dude, of course he counts. TI1's rules were different, he could've competed at any point!"

**What would success look like?** Abed shakes all remaining 10k MMR doubt, DJ expands his LAN cafe empire, Universe solidifies his spot on Dota 2's Mount Rushmore, KyoAni begins storyboarding an OVA of EE's life, and pieliedie finally closes his eyes.

And not win.

To investigate, I sifted through roughly ten different VG match discussion threads on reddit in the past few months and found only *one* person with Vici Gaming flair in any of them.

**How did they qualify?** Nisha's Dota 2 career began in around 2015 and earned him netted him ~$25,000 USD in prize winnings before joining Team Secret. After Team Secret? Nearly $300,000

**What can we expect?** Only a fool would expect the best performing team of the season to win TI.

**How to sound smart talking about Secret** During the second pick phase of any draft just casually mumble, "This *could* be an Ace Meepo game," to no one in particular.

On panels, this is known as the <abbr title="jk ilu Will <3"><i>Blitz-Storm Corollary</i></abbr>.

**What would success look like?** How convenient, I can just repeat what I said last year: Despite always being pretty good, Team Secret's highest placing at any International since the organization's inception was <i><strike>7/8<sup>th</sup> at TI5</strike></i> 5/6<sup>th</sup> at TI8. So ideally better than that.

**How did this roster happen?** Infamous? Never heard of 'em. You mean the Burger Cats? Oh hell yeah, Anvorgesa did pretty good at that last StarLadder Minor.

**How did they qualify?** The tug-of-war between Brazilian and Peruvian Dota went back to the cabinas this year.

**What can we expect?** This is the longest period of time I've seen a SA squad stick together before qualifying to TI.

**How to sound smart talking about Infamous** "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

**What would success look like?** None of the players using an offensive name during the event.

# The Qualifiers

The other ten teams came through a double elimination bracket of online qualifiers within their respective regions. Half of them had to even go through a Bo1 madhouse open qualifier for committing the cardinal sin of wanting to change rosters after February 5<sup>th</sup>.

Some trivia: Of the ten different squads to have attended an International grand final since the qualifier system was created in TI3, only three have been non-invited teams, and Wings is the only qualifier team to have ever won.

So that's where the bar is set.

**How did this roster happen?** DAC 2018 Major champions

**How did they qualify?** While allegedly on the brink of disbanding, the squad managed to beat LGD on their own home turf to win DAC. Thankfully, with VP and Liquid vacuuming up all the other DPC points, that Major win was all Mineski needed to secure their TI invite.

**What can we expect?** Mineski is one of those teams that people are mostly unsurprised no matter what result they get. Drown in group stage? *Eh, it happens.* Dominant winner's side run? *Knew they had it in them.* Don't even qualify? *Wow, SEA is so competitive!*

**How to sound smart talking about Mineski** Don't say anything, just start doing push-ups.

**What would success look like?** An iceiceice Aegis would be like the DiCaprio Oscar in terms of reddit self-satisfaction.

**How did this roster happen?** The current roster was assembled around two weeks before TI qualifiers began, so... The International 2018: Europe Open Qualifier #1 champions.

**How did they qualify?** Ana came back.

**What can we expect?**

**How to sound smart talking about OG** "I was spamming '*OG.TOPSON*' in chat before Meteor Hammer Invoker was even a twinkle in his eyes."

**What would success look like?** After multiple failed International runs, it would be only fitting that OG do well at the first TI where they're actually considered underdogs.

**How did this roster happen?** 3<sup>rd</sup> place at Epicenter XL Major

**How did they qualify?** \**read in deep announcer voice while imagining smash cuts of esports poses shrouded by smoke machines*\* Formerly known as ***FlyToMoon,*** this squad of CIS rejects took their ***region by storm*** after being assembled during the ***second half*** of the season. ***Brash, aggressive, and unpredictable.*** This roster has the ***experience to dominate*** and the ***confidence to go with it.*** This is... ***Winstrike.*** \**cut back to panel as Redeye says "Yes, indeed..." and then asks Cap a question about Iceberg probably*\*

**What can we expect?** Entertaining games and maybe a few upsets, but a deep run by Winstrike is among the darkest of horses.

**How to sound smart talking about Na`Vi** "This is good for Bitcoin."

**What would success look like?** Earlier in the season, Iceberg mentioned in an interview that they themselves don't expect to do particularly well, just getting to TI was the main goal. So mission accomplished. The real success would be if the roster stays together for more than two months post-TI.

**How did this roster happen?** 4<sup>th</sup> place at DAC 2018 Major, 2<sup>nd</sup> place at MDL Macau Minor

**How did they qualify?** Little known fact, TNC actually stands for _They Need Coaching._ Under the tutelage of Kips, the team scooped up a pretty cozy 5/6<sup>th</sup> place finish at the Kuala Lumpur Major. Shortly thereafter, they go coachless, get destroyed at the Chongqing Major, and then proceed to fall off the face off the earth. Three months later, they enter the Heen zone. The former Team Liquid coach whips the pinoy boys into shape for a 4<sup>th</sup> place finish at EPICENTER and a lock into TI.

**What can we expect?** TNC can easily take a game off any team in the entire tournament without breaking a sweat.

Scientists have yet to determine if a second game is possible.

**How to sound smart talking about TNC** Just regurgitate whatever you read on scantzor's twitter.

**What would success look like?** SA and SEA are the only regions remaining who have yet to take an Aegis.
