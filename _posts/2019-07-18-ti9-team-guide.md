### It's that magical time of year again.

Players are going into stream hibernation as bootcamps begin, Arcana propaganda campaigns are getting increasingly heated, and gaming blogs are prepping their annual piece of Dota 2 coverage to report on whichever way the prize pool goes. Ah, International season.

But not everyone has been following the professional Dota 2 scene like their livelihood depended on it. Perhaps you're the viewer who was saturated by all the tournaments and are just now tuning back in for TI. Maybe your weird friend's yearly pilgrimage to Seattle has been rerouted to Vancouver and you're shocked to learn they allow this kind of degeneracy in Canada too. Or maybe you just want to enjoy the week of festivities Valve has organized around the upcoming Artifact information session.

Whatever your story, here's a preview of the teams and memes you should know come August.

Not to worry, I've developed a foolproof guide to figure out when exactly you stopped watching Dota.

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Who is the current offlaner for EG?

<select id="dropDown" onchange="test()" style="font-weight: 100;">
 <option value="default" selected="selected">Select offlaner</option>
 <option value="one" id="RAMZES666">RAMZES666</option>
 <option value="two" id="iceiceice">iceiceice</option>
 <option value="three" id="s4">s4</option>
 <option value="four" id="UNiVeRsE">UNiVeRsE</option>
</select>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.38em; font-weight: bold;">You stopped watching Dota:
<span id="wrapperOne" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Riiiight before COVID</span>
<span id="wrapperTwo" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Never, you fiend</span>
<span id="wrapperThree" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">After TI9</span>
<span id="wrapperFour" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Well this is awkward</span>
</p>

<div id="paragraphOne" style="display: none; line-height:1.5em;">
World goes to hell in a handbasket and you just <i>leave Dota?</i> After everything we've been through together? You know we still had tournaments going on in 2020! You really missed out. Sort of. Well at least you're here now. Please don't leave again, our player count numbers can't take it.
</div>
<div id="paragraphTwo" style="display: none; line-height:1.5em;">
You're not the demographic for this guide, get outta here.

<div id="paragraphThree" style="display: none; line-height:1.5em;">
...ever heard of a "neutral item" before? No? How about the term <i>'sunmommy'</i>? Nothing? Well this is gonna be one confusing TI for you.</div>
<div id="paragraphFour" style="display: none; line-height:1.5em; font-size:large;">
Hold on a moment, let me adjust.<br><blockquote style="font-size: 1.1 em;">Oh man, long time no see! You got married? No way, I'm so happy for you! Wow one on the way too, huh, congratulations! Our stack? Nah, I'm... I'm the only one who still plays these days. Haha, yeah... Remember that one time you got a rampage on Death Prophet? Good times.

# The Invites

Here's the quick and dirty on how TI invites were determined this year. Remember the *Dota Pro Circuit/DPC*? It's back. In league form.

Six regions. Each region has an upper division and lower division league with eight teams each. For six weeks, these teams duke it out in a round-robin and whoever's at the top gets to either go to the major or move to upper division. You get DPC points for doing well in your league or doing well at the major. Major ends and the next 'season' of regional leagues begin. Rinse and repeat.

In Valve's original pitch, there were supposed to be three seasons and three majors. However, this year had to be abridged for COVID reasons. So to get to TI10, you basically had four opportunities to earn DPC points: Your regional league season 1 *(Jan-Mar 2021)*, the Singapore Major *(Apr 2021)*, your regional league season 2 *(Apr-May 2021)*, and the Kyiv AniMajor *(May 2021)*.

<hr style="margin: 0.5em 0;">

**How did this roster happen?** A lot of you reading the list above: *Arteezy, of course, my boy. Abed? What? Wait, where's Sumail! WHERE'S SUMAIL!!!* Sumail's not on EG anymore. Wild, right? Soon after TI9 ended, Sumail was benched and Abed was brought in as a replacement. But don't worry, this is a Chekhov's Hassan. He'll be back in the third act.

Iceiceice, meanwhile, finally got tired of floundering around in SEA and came to North America of all regions in Novemeber 2020 to replace Ramzes, who replaced s4 after TI9. Now you see why I chose that position to be your pro Dota familiarity barometer.

Fun fact, for all abuse Arteezy once endured for being a team hopping madman, he is currently on the longest continuous tenure of any team+player pairing at TI10 besides OG's Notail.

**How was their DPC year?** 1700 Points

***NA DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 2nd, **NA DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 2nd*

You may recall that EG were once notorious for always getting third place at events. Times have changed, though. That was a completely different roster, different meta, different era.

They've since moved up a digit.

Now for a normal person, that's pretty incredible. But Dota players, and fans, are not normal people. And in true Ricky Bobby fashion, if you ain't first, you're last.

**What can we expect?** 

**What to spam in Twitch chat when EG is winning** "The current EG roster is the largest waste of potential in the history of dota."

**What would success look like?** How funny would it be if after eight years of competing in professional Dota, Arteezy's first Valve LAN event win was TI10.

**How did this roster happen?**  Even Ame, who most would consider to be a mainstay on LGD, was actually hanging around on CDEC for most of 2020 before this roster formed. Two of the Wings Gaming TI6 winning squad? Young hotshot 12k MMR midlaner? And xiao8 coaching?

**How was their DPC year?** 1300 Points

***CN DPC S1** - 4th, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 3rd, **CN DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 1st*

**What can we expect?** The lore behind TI champions is every alternate year is a "China year." TI1 - Na'Vi (Western), TI2 - iG (Chinese), TI3 - Alliance (Western), TI4 - Newbee (Chinese), TI5 - EG (Western), TI6 - Wings (Chinese), TI7 - Liquid (Western).

In other words, these guys are the world's best chance at saving Dota from becoming a ded gaem.

**How to sound smart talking about LGD** idk lol

**How did this roster happen?** This ain't your dad's VP. No, actually, this is your little brother's VP. This group of young players had been wanting to play together for quite a while and were eventually assembled under the VP.Prodigy tag in April 2020. They had some stellar performances at a few online tournaments in 2020 and were eventually promoted to the main VP in November.

The old VP? Scattered to the four winds. Four winds of course meaning Na\`Vi who are apparently the most recent team of every </i>

**How was their DPC year?** 1200 Points

***EEU DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 7-8th, **EEU DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 9-12th*

By their own admission, their DPC leagues were FREEEEE. They literally only dropped three games out of the thirty-one total they played during the first and second season. Put 'em on LAN though? Oof. I liken it to how I never had to study at all during high school... but quickly got put in my place in university Organic Chemistry.

In their defense, this is a young team (literally, oldest player is DM at 21) with minimal LAN experience to begin with. Additionally, they were also operating with no coach until now for TI.

**What can we expect?** While VP were not the apex predators they were last season, this legendary squad has maintained the longest running roster

**How to sound smart talking about VP** "Maybe Sansheng should've written a guide on how to deal with the chat wheel."

**What would success look like?** CIS deserves another Aegis.

**What can we expect?** Jeremy Lin to make his yearly cameo, but now with some actual skin in the game. At least I hope so. If he and Asa Butterfield move to Fortnite, we're doomed.

**How did this roster happen?** A whole bunch of 3<sup>rd</sup> place finishes

**How did they qualify?** TI7's runners-up gave a less than stellar performance this season, but it was enough to squeeze into the DPC top 8 for a TI invite anyway. Their biggest mistake was getting revenge on Liquid too early in the year, thus preventing the Sccc ultra instinct arc.

**What can we expect?** This squad didn't have *amazing* results before TI7 either. They were good enough to be directly invited, but most people considered LFY or LGD to be the strongest Chinese teams at that TI. Perhaps history will repeat itself.

**How to sound smart talking about Keen** "Sccc is my free pass."

**What can we expect?** Let it All Out of You

**What can we expect?** Only a fool would expect the best performing team of the season to win TI.

**How to sound smart talking about Secret** During the second pick phase of any draft just casually mumble, "This *could* be an Ace Meepo game," to no one in particular.

On panels, this is known as the <abbr title="jk ilu Will <3"><i>Blitz-Storm Corollary</i></abbr>.

**What would success look like?** How convenient, I can just repeat what I said last year: Despite always being pretty good, Team Secret's highest placing at any International since the organization's inception was <i><strike>7/8<sup>th</sup> at TI5</strike></i> 5/6<sup>th</sup> at TI8. So ideally better than that.

**What can we expect?** This is the longest period of time I've seen a SA squad stick together before qualifying to TI.

# The Qualifiers

The other ten teams came through a double elimination bracket of online qualifiers within their respective regions. Half of them had to even go through a Bo1 madhouse open qualifier for committing the cardinal sin of wanting to change rosters after February 5<sup>th</sup>.

Some trivia: Of the ten different squads to have attended an International grand final since the qualifier system was created in TI3, only three have been non-invited teams, and Wings is the only qualifier team to have ever won.

So that's where the bar is set.

**How did this roster happen?** DAC 2018 Major champions

**How did they qualify?** While allegedly on the brink of disbanding, the squad managed to beat LGD on their own home turf to win DAC. Thankfully, with VP and Liquid vacuuming up all the other DPC points, that Major win was all Mineski needed to secure their TI invite.

**What can we expect?** Mineski is one of those teams that people are mostly unsurprised no matter what result they get. Drown in group stage? *Eh, it happens.* Dominant winner's side run? *Knew they had it in them.* Don't even qualify? *Wow, SEA is so competitive!*

**How to sound smart talking about Mineski** Don't say anything, just start doing push-ups.

**What would success look like?** An iceiceice Aegis would be like the DiCaprio Oscar in terms of reddit self-satisfaction.

**How did this roster happen?** The current roster was assembled around two weeks before TI qualifiers began, so... The International 2018: Europe Open Qualifier #1 champions.

**How did they qualify?** Ana came back.

**How to sound smart talking about OG** "I was spamming '*OG.TOPSON*' in chat before Meteor Hammer Invoker was even a twinkle in his eyes."

**How did this roster happen?** 3<sup>rd</sup> place at Epicenter XL Major

**How did they qualify?** \**read in deep announcer voice while imagining smash cuts of esports poses shrouded by smoke machines*\* Formerly known as ***FlyToMoon,*** this squad of CIS rejects took their ***region by storm*** after being assembled during the ***second half*** of the season. ***Brash, aggressive, and unpredictable.*** This roster has the ***experience to dominate*** and the ***confidence to go with it.*** This is... ***Winstrike.*** \**cut back to panel as Redeye says "Yes, indeed..." and then asks Cap a question about Iceberg probably*\*

**What can we expect?** Entertaining games and maybe a few upsets, but a deep run by Winstrike is among the darkest of horses.

**How to sound smart talking about Na`Vi** "This is good for Bitcoin."

**What would success look like?** Earlier in the season, Iceberg mentioned in an interview that they themselves don't expect to do particularly well, just getting to TI was the main goal. So mission accomplished. The real success would be if the roster stays together for more than two months post-TI.

**How did this roster happen?** 4<sup>th</sup> place at DAC 2018 Major, 2<sup>nd</sup> place at MDL Macau Minor

**How did they qualify?** Little known fact, TNC actually stands for _They Need Coaching._ Under the tutelage of Kips, the team scooped up a pretty cozy 5/6<sup>th</sup> place finish at the Kuala Lumpur Major. Shortly thereafter, they go coachless, get destroyed at the Chongqing Major, and then proceed to fall off the face off the earth. Three months later, they enter the Heen zone. The former Team Liquid coach whips the pinoy boys into shape for a 4<sup>th</sup> place finish at EPICENTER and a lock into TI.

**What can we expect?** TNC can easily take a game off any team in the entire tournament without breaking a sweat.

Scientists have yet to determine if a second game is possible.

**How to sound smart talking about TNC** Just regurgitate whatever you read on scantzor's twitter.

**What would success look like?** SA and SEA are the only regions remaining who have yet to take an Aegis.
