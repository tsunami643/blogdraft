### It's that magical time of year again.

Players are going into stream hibernation as bootcamps begin, Arcana propaganda campaigns are getting increasingly heated, and gaming blogs are prepping their annual piece of Dota 2 coverage to report on whichever way the prize pool goes. Ah, International season.

But not everyone has been following the professional Dota 2 scene like their livelihood depended on it. Perhaps you're the viewer who was saturated by all the tournaments and are just now tuning back in for TI. Maybe your weird friend's yearly pilgrimage to Seattle has been rerouted to Vancouver and you're shocked to learn they allow this kind of degeneracy in Canada too. Or maybe you just want to enjoy the week of festivities Valve has organized around the upcoming Artifact information session.

Whatever your story, here's a preview of the teams and memes you should know come August.

Not to worry, I've developed a foolproof guide to figure out when exactly you stopped watching Dota.

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Who is the current offlaner for EG?

<select id="dropDown" onchange="test()" style="font-weight: 100;">

 <option value="three" id="s4">s4</option>
 <option value="four" id="UNiVeRsE">UNiVeRsE</option>

</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.38em; font-weight: bold;">You stopped watching Dota:
<span id="wrapperOne" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Riiiight before COVID</span>
<span id="wrapperTwo" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Never, you fiend</span>

World goes to hell in a handbasket and you just <i>leave Dota?</i> After everything we've been through together? You know we still had tournaments going on in 2020! You really missed out. Sort of. Well at least you're here now. Please don't leave again, our player count numbers can't take it.

# The Invites

Here's the quick and dirty on how TI invites were determined this year. Remember the *Dota Pro Circuit/DPC*? It's back. In league form.

Six regions. Each region has an upper division and lower division league with eight teams each. For six weeks, these teams duke it out in a round-robin and whoever's at the top gets to either go to the major or move to upper division. You get DPC points for doing well in your league or doing well at the major. Major ends and the next 'season' of regional leagues begin. Rinse and repeat.

In Valve's original pitch, there were supposed to be three seasons and three majors. However, this year had to be abridged for COVID reasons. So to get to TI10, you basically had four opportunities to earn DPC points: Your regional league season 1 *(Jan-Mar 2021)*, the Singapore Major *(Apr 2021)*, your regional league season 2 *(Apr-May 2021)*, and the Kyiv AniMajor *(May 2021)*.

<hr style="margin: 0.5em 0;">

**How did this roster happen?** A lot of you reading the list above: *Arteezy, of course, my boy. Abed? What? Wait, where's Sumail! WHERE'S SUMAIL!!!* Sumail's not on EG anymore. Wild, right? Soon after TI9 ended, Sumail was benched and Abed was brought in. But don't worry, this is a Chekhov's Hassan. He'll be back in the third act.

Iceiceice, meanwhile, finally got tired of floundering around in SEA and came to North America of all regions in Novemeber 2020 to replace Ramzes, who replaced s4 after TI9. Now you see why I chose that position to be your pro Dota familiarity barometer.

Fun fact, for all abuse Arteezy once endured for being a team hopping madman, he is currently on the longest continuous tenure of any team+player pairing at TI10 besides OG's Notail.

**How was their DPC year?** 1700 points

***NA DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 2nd, **NA DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 2nd*

You may recall that EG were once notorious for always getting third place at events. Times have changed, though. That was a completely different roster, different meta, different era.

They've since moved up a digit.

Now for a normal person, 2nd place at two majors is pretty incredible. But Dota players, and fans, are not normal people. And in true Ricky Bobby fashion, if you ain't first, you're last. *What a joke of a year. Abed Storm for five games? 1 position NP in grand finals? smh can we kick Bulba please?*

**What would success look like?** How funny would it be if after eight years of competing in professional Dota, Arteezy's first Valve LAN event win was TI10.

**How did this roster happen?**  Just reading these names, how could you not get hype. Two of the Wings Gaming TI6 winning squad? Young hotshot 12k MMR midlaner? And xiao8 coaching? LET'S GOOOOO.

In fact Ame, who may seem like the only connection to the TI9 LGD, actually traded spots with AhJit on CDEC for most of 2020 before this roster formed in September. Was he being given a lesson in humility? Who knows, but there's never been a better time to be an lgdamefan.

**How was their DPC year?** 1300 Points

***CN DPC S1** - 4th, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 3rd, **CN DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 1st*

As is tradition with LGDs past, they started the year off *cold*. Granted, the CN DPC is arguably the most competitive of all the six regional leagues, but they only narrowly won a 4/5th place tiebreaker against Elephant in the CN DPC S1 to even get the privilege of attending the Singapore Major. They took the momentum swimmingly, though, and proceeded to bring their A-game for the rest of the year.

**What would success look like?** Statistically, [LGD has the highest probability of winning TI10.](https://noxville.github.io/ti10-probabilities/) Also statistically, the team with the highest probability of winning TI rarely ever does. RIP LGD.

**How did this roster happen?** This ain't your dad's VP. No, actually, this is your little brother's VP. This is a group of young players who had been wanting to form a team together for quite a while and were eventually assembled under the *VP.Prodigy* tag in April 2020. They had some stellar performances at a few online tournaments and were eventually promoted to the main VP in November 2020.

The old VP? Scattered to the four winds. Four winds of course meaning Na\`Vi who are apparently the most recent team on every one of those players' history.

**How was their DPC year?** 1200 Points

***EEU DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 7-8th, **EEU DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 9-12th*

By their own admission, their DPC leagues were FREEEEE. They literally only dropped three out of the thirty-one total games they played during both seasons. Put 'em on LAN though? Weelllll, there they do not look great. I liken it to how I never had to study at all during high school. Physics? Simple. World History? Cram the night before.

Then I roll up to university and get punched in the mouth by Organic Chemistry. Still have nightmares of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.

In VP's defense, this is a young team (literally, oldest player is DM at 21) with minimal LAN experience to begin with. Additionally, they were also operating with no coach until now for TI.

**What would success look like?** For the first time in years, the Virtus Pro brand doesn't have astronomical TI expectations. After placing 2nd and 3rd at the two online ESL tournaments after the DPC ended, no one should be questioning if this team is actually good. What people don't know, however, is if they can handle pressure. This roster hasn't ever even played in front of a crowd before.

The EEU/CIS region hasn't even had a team place top 4 at TI since TI3 Na`Vi, so anything near there would be impressive.

**How did this roster happen?** Yawar, Quinn, and MSS have actually been together since 2018 if you can believe it. It was as Forward Gaming, who got turned into TI9 Newbee, who got turned into Quincy Crew, who got turned into Chaos EC, who again turned into Quincy Crew and have remained so since early 2020. Along the way, they imported the Brazilian Lelis and brought LoA/SVG out of semi-retirement.

**How was their DPC year?** 1100 Points

***NA DPC S1** - 2nd, **ONE Esports Singapore Major\*** - 9-12th, **NA DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 5-6th*

In 2020, most everyone had written off North America as a region beyond saving and it was basically just EG's playground.

In 2021, we learned that North America is indeed mostly beyond saving, but there are actually *two* bullies at the playground with Quincy Crew.

Quincy Crew not only gave EG a run for their money in the NA DPC, but was also looking surprisingly strong at international LANs. Their Singapore Major result has an asterisk because QC had to use a stand-in of Poloson due to MSS contracting COVID.

**What would success look like?** Getting a sponsor next year.

Actually, wait, scratch that. *Quincy Crew* becoming an esports powerhouse would be the real success story.

**How did this roster happen?** Unlike most of the other Chinese teams at this TI, this roster was *not* frantically cobbled together in late 2020. Instead, it was a slow, methodical process that has had these five players together since late 2019.

**How was their DPC year?** 1100 Points

***CN DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 1st, **NA DPC S2** - 4th, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor\*** - 15th*

This team's story is probably best told through greentext.

```
>walks into the dpc
>decides to reverse sweep singapore grand finals halfway through game 3

It's like pottery.

Their coach did have to stand-in for Oli at the AniMajor, sure, but I prefer my interpretation.

**How did this roster happen?** Yes, this is *that* T1. The Faker T1. The... tyler1 T1. The T1 brand that's a juggernaut in Korea. Originally announced in late 2019 with Forev at the center, T1 went through multiple iterations before finally putting together this surprisingly multinational SEA team right before the DPC started. The last addition was 23savage who replaced JaCkky after the Singapore Major.

**How was their DPC year?** 1070 Points

***SEA DPC S1** - 3rd, **ONE Esports Singapore Major\*** - 15th, **SEA DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 3rd*

SEA had an interesting conundrum this year. Since their league was so intra-regionally competitive, no singular team was able to farm the leagues for DPC points. As a result, there was a very real possibility that the only SEA team to attend TI would be the SEA regional qualifier winner.

**What would success look like?** I talked about CIS/EEU not having any team in top 4 at TI for a while. SEA, meanwhile, hasn't had a top *8* placement at TI since TI6.

**How did this roster happen?** A whole bunch of 2<sup>nd</sup> place finishes

**What can we expect?** Just some real solid Dotes. You know, a real focus on the fundamentals. The guys are gonna give it their all. Show some real hustle out there.

And not win.

**How to sound smart talking about VG** How does one even talk about Vici to begin with? To investigate, I sifted through roughly ten different VG match discussion threads on reddit in the past few months and found only *one* person with Vici Gaming flair in any of them. You are a lost soul, /u/OPQOP, but I hope you find happiness as a VG fan.

**How did this roster happen?** It'd be shorter to list their non-notable tournament placings this season. It was Epicenter. They got bodied at Epicenter. But the rest of the season was 👌

**How did they qualify?** Nisha's Dota 2 career began in around 2015 and earned him netted him ~$25,000 USD in prize winnings before joining Team Secret. After Team Secret? Nearly $300,000

**What can we expect?** Only a fool would expect the best performing team of the season to win TI.

**How to sound smart talking about Secret** During the second pick phase of any draft just casually mumble, "This *could* be an Ace Meepo game," to no one in particular.

On panels, this is known as the <abbr title="jk ilu Will <3"><i>Blitz-Storm Corollary</i></abbr>.

**What would success look like?** How convenient, I can just repeat what I said last year: Despite always being pretty good, Team Secret's highest placing at any International since the organization's inception was <i><strike>7/8<sup>th</sup> at TI5</strike></i> 5/6<sup>th</sup> at TI8. So ideally better than that.

**How did they qualify?** In the divine game of mahjong that randomly determines whichever Chinese team is intra-regionally strongest on any given week, the gods willed that Serenity shall be victorious.

**What can we expect?** Honestly, no one knows. Anyone who claims otherwise is just trying to sound smart.

**How to sound smart talking about RNG** "lmaoooo maybe if you watched *actual* amateur dota and not grant streams of trashcan na pubs youd know my boys have been looking like TI winners since hcup season 8"

**What would success look like?** Not getting banned by ACE next year.

**How did this roster happen?** 2<sup>nd</sup> place at The Bucharest Major. Also won Galaxy Battles II, but I'm the only person who cares about that tournament.

**How did they qualify?** In a cutthroat they beat gambit

**What can we expect?** Not that.

**How to sound smart talking about Alliance** Without scrolling up, name the other three players who aren't ddc or Sylar.

**What would success look like?** Beyond ddc potentially becoming the last of the <abbr title="Puppey, Universe, Kuroky, ddc">Elite Four all-TI attendees</abbr> to earn an Aegis, a victory for their coach, the ever-lovable rOtK, would be something to celebrate for Eastern and Western Dota fans alike.

# The Qualifiers

The other ten teams came through a double elimination bracket of online qualifiers within their respective regions. Half of them had to even go through a Bo1 madhouse open qualifier for committing the cardinal sin of wanting to change rosters after February 5<sup>th</sup>.

Some trivia: Of the ten different squads to have attended an International grand final since the qualifier system was created in TI3, only three have been non-invited teams, and Wings is the only qualifier team to have ever won.

So that's where the bar is set.

**How did this roster happen?** DAC 2018 Major champions

**How did they qualify?** While allegedly on the brink of disbanding, the squad managed to beat LGD on their own home turf to win DAC. Thankfully, with VP and Liquid vacuuming up all the other DPC points, that Major win was all Mineski needed to secure their TI invite.

**What can we expect?** Mineski is one of those teams that people are mostly unsurprised no matter what result they get. Drown in group stage? *Eh, it happens.* Dominant winner's side run? *Knew they had it in them.* Don't even qualify? *Wow, SEA is so competitive!*

**How to sound smart talking about Mineski** Don't say anything, just start doing push-ups.

**What would success look like?** An iceiceice Aegis would be like the DiCaprio Oscar in terms of reddit self-satisfaction.

**What would success look like?** After multiple failed International runs, it would be only fitting that OG do well at the first TI where they're actually considered underdogs.

**How did this roster happen?** 3<sup>rd</sup> place at Epicenter XL Major

***EEU DPC S1** - 4th, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - Did not attend, **EEU DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 7-8th*

SEA had an interesting conundrum this year. Since their league was so intra-regionally competitive, no singular team was able to farm the leagues for DPC points. As a result, there was a very real possibility that the only SEA team to attend TI would be the SEA regional qualifier winner.

**What would success look like?** I talked about CIS/EEU not having any team in top 4 at TI for a while. SEA, meanwhile, hasn't had a top *8* placement at TI since TI6. TI3's 3rd place Orange and TI6's 4th place Fnatic are the only times
