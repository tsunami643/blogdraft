### It's that magical time of year again.

Players are going into stream hibernation as bootcamps begin, Arcana propaganda campaigns are getting increasingly heated, and gaming blogs are prepping their annual piece of Dota 2 coverage to report on whichever way the prize pool goes. Ah, International season.

But not everyone has been following the professional Dota 2 scene like their livelihood depended on it. Perhaps you're the viewer who was saturated by all the tournaments and are just now tuning back in for TI. Maybe your weird friend's yearly pilgrimage to Seattle has been rerouted to Vancouver and you're shocked to learn they allow this kind of degeneracy in Canada too. Or maybe you just want to enjoy the week of festivities Valve has organized around the upcoming Artifact information session.

Whatever your story, here's a preview of the teams and memes you should know come August.

Not to worry, I've developed a foolproof guide to figure out when exactly you stopped watching Dota.

<p style="font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;">Who is the current offlaner for EG?

<select id="dropDown" onchange="test()" style="font-weight: 100;">

<p style="font-size: 1.38em; font-weight: bold;">You stopped watching Dota:

<span id="wrapperTwo" style="display: none;font-weight: 100;">Never, you fiend</span>

# The Invites

Here's the quick and dirty on how TI invites were determined this year. Remember the *Dota Pro Circuit/DPC*? It's back. In league form.

Six regions. Each region has an upper division and lower division league with eight teams each. For six weeks, these teams duke it out in a round-robin and whoever's at the top gets to either go to the major or move to upper division. You get DPC points for doing well in your league or doing well at the major. Major ends and the next 'season' of regional leagues begin. Rinse and repeat.

In Valve's original pitch, there were supposed to be three seasons and three majors. However, this year had to be abridged for COVID reasons. So to get to TI10, you basically had four opportunities to earn DPC points: Your regional league season 1 *(Jan-Mar 2021)*, the Singapore Major *(Apr 2021)*, your regional league season 2 *(Apr-May 2021)*, and the Kyiv AniMajor *(May 2021)*.

<hr style="margin: 0.5em 0;">

**How did this roster happen?** A lot of you reading the list above: *Arteezy, of course, my boy. Abed? What? Wait, where's Sumail?!* Sumail's not on EG anymore. Wild, I know. Soon after TI9 ended, Sumail was benched and Abed was brought in. But don't worry, this is a Chekhov's Hassan. He'll be back in the third act.

Iceiceice, meanwhile, finally got tired of floundering around in SEA and came to North America of all regions in Novemeber 2020 to replace Ramzes, who replaced s4 after TI9. Now you see why I chose that position to be your pro Dota familiarity barometer.

Fun fact, for all abuse Arteezy once endured for being a treacherous team hopper, he is currently on the longest continuous tenure of any team+player pairing at TI10 besides Crit, Secret's Puppey, and OG's Notail. They grow up so fast.

**How was their DPC year?** 1700 points

* ***NA DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 2nd, **NA DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 2nd*

You may recall that EG were once notorious for always getting third place at events. Times have changed, though. That was a completely different roster, different meta, different era.

They've since moved up a digit.

Now for a normal person, 2nd place at two majors is pretty incredible. But Dota players, and fans, are not normal people. And in true Ricky Bobby fashion, if you ain't first, you're last. *What a joke of a year. Abed Storm for five games? 1 position NP in grand finals? smh can we kick Bulba please?*

**What would success look like?** How funny would it be if after eight years of competing in professional Dota, Arteezy's first Valve LAN event win was TI10.

**How did this roster happen?**  Just reading these names, how could you not get hype. Two of the Wings Gaming TI6 winning squad? Young hotshot 12k MMR midlaner? And xiao8 coaching? LET'S GOOOOO.

In fact Ame, who may seem like the only connection to the TI9 LGD, actually traded spots with AhJit on CDEC for most of 2020 before this roster formed in September. Was he being given a lesson in humility? Who knows, but there's never been a better time to be an lgdamefan.

**How was their DPC year?** 1300 Points

***CN DPC S1** - 4th, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 3rd, **CN DPC S2** - 2nd, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 1st*

As is tradition with LGDs past, they started the year off *cold*. Granted, the CN DPC is arguably the most competitive of all the six regional leagues, but they only narrowly won a 4/5th place tiebreaker against Elephant in the CN DPC S1 to even get the privilege of attending the Singapore Major. They took the momentum swimmingly, though, and proceeded to bring their A-game for the rest of the year.

**What would success look like?** Statistically, [LGD has the highest probability of winning TI10.](https://noxville.github.io/ti10-probabilities/) Also statistically, the team with the highest probability of winning TI rarely ever does. RIP LGD.

**How did this roster happen?** This ain't your dad's VP. No, actually, this is your little brother's VP. This is a group of young players who had been wanting to form a team together for quite a while and were eventually assembled under the *VP.Prodigy* tag in April 2020. They had some stellar performances at a few online tournaments and were eventually promoted to the main VP in November 2020.

The old VP? Scattered to the four winds. Four winds of course meaning Na\`Vi who are apparently the most recent team on every one of those players' history.

**How was their DPC year?** 1200 Points

***EEU DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 7-8th, **EEU DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 9-12th*

By their own admission, their DPC leagues were FREEEEE. They literally only dropped three out of the thirty-one total games they played during both seasons. Put 'em on LAN though? Weelllll, there they do not look great. I liken it to how I never had to study at all during high school. Physics? Simple. World History? Cram the night before.

Then I roll up to university and get punched in the mouth by Organic Chemistry. Still have nightmares of S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions.

In VP's defense, this is a young team (literally, oldest player is DM at 21) with minimal LAN experience to begin with. Additionally, they were also operating with no coach until now for TI.

**What would success look like?** For the first time in years, the Virtus Pro brand doesn't have astronomical TI expectations. After placing 2nd and 3rd at the two online ESL tournaments after the DPC ended, no one should be questioning if this team is actually good. What people don't know, however, is if they can handle pressure. This roster hasn't ever even played in front of a crowd before.

The EEU/CIS region hasn't even had a team place top 4 at TI since TI3 Na`Vi, so anything near there would be impressive.

**How did this roster happen?** Yawar, Quinn, and MSS have actually been together since 2018 if you can believe it. It was as Forward Gaming, who got turned into TI9 Newbee, who got turned into Quincy Crew, who got turned into Chaos EC, who again turned into Quincy Crew and have remained so since early 2020. Along the way, they imported the Brazilian Lelis and brought LoA/SVG out of semi-retirement.

**How was their DPC year?** 1100 Points

***NA DPC S1** - 2nd, **ONE Esports Singapore Major\*** - 9-12th, **NA DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 5-6th*

In 2020, most everyone had written off North America as a region beyond saving and it was basically just EG's playground.

In 2021, we learned that North America is indeed mostly beyond saving, but there are actually *two* bullies at the playground with Quincy Crew.

Quincy Crew not only gave EG a run for their money in the NA DPC, but was also looking surprisingly strong at international LANs. Their Singapore Major result has an asterisk because QC had to use a stand-in of Poloson due to MSS contracting COVID.

**What would success look like?** Getting a sponsor next year.

Actually, wait, scratch that. *Quincy Crew* becoming an esports powerhouse would be the real success story.

**How did this roster happen?** Unlike most of the other Chinese teams at this TI, this roster was *not* frantically cobbled together in late 2020. Instead, it was a slow, methodical process that has had these five players together since late 2019.

**How was their DPC year?** 1100 Points

***CN DPC S1** - 1st, **ONE Esports Singapore Major** - 1st, **NA DPC S2** - 4th, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor\*** - 15th*

This team's story is probably best told through greentext.

```
>walks into the dpc
>decides to reverse sweep singapore grand finals halfway through game 3

It's like pottery.

Their coach did have to stand-in for Oli at the AniMajor, sure, but I prefer my interpretation.

**How did this roster happen?** Yes, this is *that* T1. The Faker T1. The... tyler1 T1. The T1 brand that's a juggernaut in Korea. Originally announced in late 2019 with Forev at the center, T1 went through multiple iterations before finally putting together this surprisingly multinational SEA team right before the DPC started. The last addition was 23savage who replaced JaCkky after the Singapore Major.

***SEA DPC S1** - 3rd, **ONE Esports Singapore Major\*** - 15th, **SEA DPC S2** - 1st, **WePlay Kyiv AniMajor** - 3rd*

SEA had an interesting conundrum this year. Since their league was so intra-regionally competitive, no singular team was able to farm the leagues for DPC points. As a result, there was a very real possibility that the only SEA team to attend TI would be the SEA regional qualifier winner.

**What would success look like?** I talked about CIS/EEU not having any team in top 4 at TI for a while. SEA, meanwhile, hasn't had a top *8* placement at TI since TI6.

# The Qualifiers

The other ten teams came through a double elimination bracket of online qualifiers within their respective regions. Half of them had to even go through a Bo1 madhouse open qualifier for committing the cardinal sin of wanting to change rosters after February 5<sup>th</sup>.

Some trivia: Of the ten different squads to have attended an International grand final since the qualifier system was created in TI3, only three have been non-invited teams, and Wings is the only qualifier team to have ever won.

So that's where the bar is set.

When I said that there were only two teams worth paying attention to in NA, perhaps I was being too dismissive. I'm willing to stretch to three, with Undying. While coming just barely short of qualifying to both majors, they plowed through the NA regional qualifier without dropping a single game.

# What about...?

Only 18 teams made it, which leaves a lot of

## North America

#### The rest of TI5 EG (ppd, Universe, Aui_2000)
* After TI9, ppd and Universe reunited on NiP. They actually qualified for the March 2020 ESL Los Angeles major right before COVID hit. The tournament got canceled and they both promptly retired. Peter then un-retired, competed in the NA DPC S1, stopped doing that, became Alliance's coach for the EU DPC S2, stopped doing that, and then was invited to cast TI10, but also stopped doing that.<br><br>Universe *actually* retired and recently [got married!](https://twitter.com/UniverseDota/status/1426214388508233731)<br><br>Aui seems content with his current coach/caster status and will also be joining the TI10 English broadcast.

#### EternaLEnVy
* They stopped following the manga this year and instead we got some weird filler arc where Envy doesn't read the DPC rules and then acts surprised at the end of the season.<br><br>After floating around in the NA lower and upper divisions, Jacky Mao slapped together a team for the TI10 qualifier with Ryoya, Kingrd/Mr. Kingão, Zfreek, and Moo. Got third after losing to *4 Zoomers (Sammyboy, Gunnar, Brax, ocean, Husky)*. Pretty unsatisfying conclusion, idk if I'll watch next season...

#### Mason

* Now a professional speech writer on twitch dot tv.

## South America

#### hFn
* If you didn't catch it, Fear is

#### Duster
* They're great! 

## Western Europe

#### Miracle-, w33, MinD_ContRoL, GH, KuroKy, iLTW
* Ah, you mean *Team Nigma*? Yes, that's their name. Well, actually, it's *Nigma Galaxy* now. After TI9, Kuro took the path of Secret and OG and decided to create his own organization. 2020 had a few exciting wins for Nigma, but 2021 was mostly rocky. They attended the Singapore Major with a stand-in, bombed out, benched w33 for iLTW in season 2, attended the AniMajor, and ultimately landed 13th place in the DPC rankings. One slot away from being directly invited to TI through points. In the WEU regional qualifier, they got 3rd after narrowly losing to longtime rivals OG and bowed out of the competition. <br><br>Their fans have not taken the loss particularly well. Rather than graciously accept defeat, many Nigma diehards have been channeling their frustrations by: belittling the competitive integrity of other regions, condemning the DPC structure, trying to convince everyone this TI will suck because their team isn't there, and eagerly licking their chops to sub-in when news broke that some Chinese teams in Bucharest have COVID. Some real *BERNIE CAN STILL WIN* vibes out in the Nigma camp.

#### Team Liquid in general
* After Kuro splintered off to form Nigma, Liquid signed TI9's Alliance of miCKe, qojqva, Boxi, Taiga, and iNSaNiA. The team did well enough to show up to both majors, but they only "showed up" and not much more than that. Ultimately, they got 4th in the EU regional qualifiers after losing to Nigma.

#### Hmmmm... if Nigma got 3rd and Liquid got 4th, who got 2nd?
* A team by the name of *Tundra Esports* with Skiter, Nine, 33, Sneyking, and Fata. Tundra never showed up to any majors, but they got nail-bitingly close to beating OG in the WEU TI10 qualifiers. Incidentally, this is the first International Fata has missed since he started competing at *TI3.*
